# Mission-to-Mars
HTML Web scraping on Mars data to create a Flask web application using Python and MongoDB

## Overview
Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, I’ll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Errors on Project
After over 10 hours of installing, errors, and troubleshooting due to MongoDB refusing to start, the program tries to run however is met at an error when opening the index.html.
